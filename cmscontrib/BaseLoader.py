    Each loader must extend this class and support the following
    access pattern:

      * The class methods short_name(), description() and detect() can
        be called at any time.

      * Once a loader is instatiated, get_contest() can be called on
        it, only once.

      * After get_contest() has been called, at the caller's will,
        get_task() and get_user() can be called, in any order and for
        how many times the caller want. The resource intensive
        operations that are not needed for get_contest() are better
        left in get_task() or get_user(), so that no time is wasted if
        the caller isn't interested in users or tasks.
