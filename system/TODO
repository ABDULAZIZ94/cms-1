*** FileStorage

*** FileStorageLib

*** CouchObject and related (Contest, User, ...)
* Manage all conflicts arising from to_couch(), everywhere in the source code.

*** Sandbox

*** Worker

*** EvaluationServer
* MINOR: Job Dispatcher sometimes dies before responding to the XML-RPC request
  or messing up things with the closing Python interpreter.
* Isn't able to cope with an unreachable worker.
* Check that there are no concurrence issues, particularly in scoring
  routines.

*** ContestWebServer
* It _MUST_ be able to work correctly (storing submitted data) even if
  no services other than CouchDB and File Storage are available; if
  CouchDB or File Storage it _MUST_ behave nicely anyway, informing
  the user to seek assistance and without crashing.

*** Task types
* Check that white_diff() really does what we want it to do

*** Score types
* Fix ScoreTypeRelative, which at the moment still use the deprecated
  Submission.score field.

*** Importer
* Provide facilities to translate the task's statement.
* Provide an environment to build tasks better than make_Makefile and friends.
