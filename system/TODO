*** FileStorage

*** FileStorageLib

*** CouchObject and related (Contest, User, ...)

*** Sandbox

*** Worker

*** EvaluationServer
* Job Dispatcher sometimes dies before responding to the XML-RPC request
  or messing up things with the closing Python interpreter.
* Isn't able to cope with an unreachable worker.

*** ContestWebServer
* It _MUST_ be able to work correctly (storing submitted data) even if
  no services other than CouchDB and File Storage are available; if
  CouchDB or File Storage it _MUST_ behave nicely anyway, informing
  the user to seek assistance and without crashing.

*** Task types
* Check that white_diff() really does what we want it to do

*** Score types

*** Importer
* Provide facilities to translate the task's statement.
