*** Database
* Define appropriate UNIQUE indexes in the database.
* Task and Testcase are sometimes referenced by num, instead of
  properly using IDs.
* Decide where and how to keep tries number for evaluations.
* Rename token_timestamp -> token.

*** Worker
* Should be able to work with 32-bit programs even when running in 64-bit mode.
* Investigate why pressing keys on Worker seems to impact
  the result of an ongoing mo-box.

*** EvaluationServer
* Check that there are no concurrence issues, particularly in scoring
  routines.
* BUG: Scoring doesn't work correctly, because the Task objects get
  rebuild each time.

*** ContestWebServer
* It _MUST_ be able to work correctly (storing submitted data) even if
  no services other than the database and FileStorage are available;
  if database or File Storage are missing it _MUST_ behave nicely
  anyway, informing the user to seek assistance and without crashing.
* Localization (task statements, but also interface).

*** Task types
* Check that white_diff() really does what we want it to do

*** Score types
* Fix ScoreTypeRelative, which at the moment still use the deprecated
  Submission.score field.

*** Importer
* Provide facilities to translate the task's statement.
* Provide an environment to build tasks better than make_Makefile and friends.

*** ContestExporter
* Exporting the whole database means more than a single contest.
* Provide an importer.
