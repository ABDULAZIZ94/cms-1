*** Database
* LOW: Define appropriate UNIQUE indexes in the database.
* LOW: Task and Testcase are sometimes referenced by num, instead of
  properly using IDs.
* LOW: It may be interesting to keep in the Contest not only the last
  scoring snapshot, but a snapshot for each moments in which the
  scorings change.
* HIGH: Ensure that CWS in particular, but also everything else, does not
  rely on the particular value of the id of the database
  objects. E.g., we may assume that everything work as expected even
  if we scramble all ids int he db (keeping the relations correct, of
  course). This actually happens when we call ContestExporter and
  ContestImporter.

*** Worker
* LOW: Should be able to work with 32 bits programs even when running in
  64 bits mode.
  - This actually appears to be quite complicated: it is probably
    easier and more secure to just ask that everything must be made
    with the same number of bits; at the moment it is assumed that
    everything works at 32 bits. I have a 64 bits system and keep
    the Worker inside a 32 bits chroot.

*** EvaluationServer
* HIGH: Check that there are no concurrence issues, particularly in scoring
  routines.
* MED: When starting, check that the workers are not doing anything and
  possibly stop them / wait for them to be finished.
* HIGH: Really, really slow to add the already evaluated submissions at
  start. The problem seems to be at ScoreType level (i.e., rebuilding
  the scores each time something new arrive, even if scoretype is not
  relative).

*** ContestWebServer
* HIGH: It _MUST_ be able to work correctly (storing submitted data) even if
  no services other than the database and FileStorage are available;
  if database or File Storage are missing it _MUST_ behave nicely
  anyway, informing the user to seek assistance and without crashing.
* LOW: Some idea to improve the Web interface:
  - Ability to show submitted files from the Web interface without
    having to download them, possibly coloring the syntax.
  - Ability to backup files.
  - Ability to talk with Emacs psychologist, in case of a particularly
    difficult contest.
  - Put an Italian flag somewhere.
  - I think that the AGPL license also asks us to put appropriate
    copyright notices in the Web interface.

*** Task types
* MED: Check that white_diff() really does what we want it to do.
  - This requires someone different from the author (Giovanni) to
    audit it.
* HIGH: Test that all languages (particularly Pascal) work correctly.

*** YamlImporter
* LOW: Provide facilities to translate the task's statement.
* LOW: Provide an environment to build tasks better than make_Makefile and
  friends.

*** Contest{Exporter,Importer}
* LOW: Use consistenly names to export Tasks, as in the cases of Users.

*** File{Storage,Cacher}
* MED: Don't load the whole files when transferring them, you uselessly eat
  a huge lot of memory.
* MED: The current implementation is very confused and probably quite
  prone to errors; try to make it a bit simpler.
* LOW: Add support to optionally check file digests when trasferring them, both
  on client and on server side. Moreover, add an API call to ask the
  server to verify some file's digest.
* HIGH: Duly document callbacks in FileCacher.

*** AsyncLibrary
* HIGH: Duly document the make_sync decorator.
* HIGH: Understand which call we need when a long running function has time
  to spare (_step? asyncore.loop?), for example as in make_sync
  implementation.
  - Actually, synchronous interfaces are a pain anyway. We should just
    not use them in the main system (importers, exporters and other things
    are fine, since they're not critical and run human-assisted).
* MED: Decide on bind_obj=None behaviour and about keeping bind_obj.
* MED: Add a method to do a one-time deferred call (like add_timeout(),
  but just one time).
  - Already done, but it has many shortcomings and completely breaks
    synchronous interfaces.
* MED: Fix sync default.
