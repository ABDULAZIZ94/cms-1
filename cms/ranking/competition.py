"""Manage submissions to get scores and statistics.

This is the main module needed to manage the results of a competition.

It needs a data provider to load the configuration of the competition
(composed by the definitions of contests, tasks, teams and users) and
to receive notifications about submissions. Submissions can be created
and updated (for example when the user releases it or when the score is
adjusted during the contest). In the history, the updated information
about a submission will be shown only after the timestamp of the update
itself, to appropriately match what was visible in the live scoreboard.

Notifications doesn't need to be received in real time nor in the order
they happened, since this module will adjust the current scores and
update the history accordingly.

In case some retroactive changes need to be perfomed (for example after
a reevaluation of a task) the data provider can change that data and
have the competition module reload it all again, effectively changing
both the current scores and the history.

The module is composed by four classes that store the data, along with
a dictionary for each of them to easily retrive data by ID:
 * Contest: represents a contest, that is a set of tasks and a time
            period in which users have to solve them
 * Task: a task
 * Team: a team, that is a set of users
 * User: a user, that is a contestant, that scores points on the tasks

The Submission class is used to store the data about the submissions
the user do on the tasks. There's no global storage for them since
they're memorized on a per-user/per-task basis.

The Score class is where the actual computation happens. There's one
instance of it for each user for each task. It receives notifications
about submissions and it provides the current score, the current set
of submissions and the history of score changes.

The load_data and unload_data functions are used by the data provider
to control the data that this module has access to. They're only used
to provide configuration data - the submissions are provided using
scores[user][task].create_submission and update_submission.

The get_global_history and compute_rank_history functions are helpers
called to compute specific information requested by the clients.
