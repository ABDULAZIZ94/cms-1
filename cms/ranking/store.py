"""A module providing storage facilities for entities.

It provides four EntityStore instances for the four main entity types.
Each EntityStore provides methods to modify the data and to receive
notifications about data updates.

Entities are represented as dicts, containing the entity's properties.

The EntityStores are persistent: they store the data on disk and load
it again when the program is restared.
