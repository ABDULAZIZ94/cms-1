*** HOW TO RUN CMS FOR THE FIRST TIME

First of all, there are some choice you can do: run it on a 32 or 64
bit system, and use PostgreSQL or SQLite for the database. In this
guide we restrict to the simplest case (32 bit and SQLite). For
different choice, look at the relative guide in the documentation
(32bit_sandbox_howto.txt and postgresql_howto.txt).

Said that, you can run CMS in two ways: from the repository, or
install it in the system.


** RUN IT FROM THE REPOSITORY

We assume that you already cloned the repository, and that $CMSPATH is
the path of the cms directory in the repository (i.e., the parent of
doc/).

* DEPENDENCIES

You need some dependencies (the Ubuntu packages are in brackets):
- SQLAlchemy packages for Python (python-sqlalchemy);
- simplejson library for Python (python-simplejson);
- Tornado (python-tornado).

* LOCALIZATION

Next, you need to compile the localization you are interested
in. Create the directory $CMSPATH/cms/server/mo/<code>/LC_MESSAGES/ for
every country code <code>, and run the command
$ msgfmt $CMSPATH/cms/server/po/<code>.po \
  -o $CMSPATH/cms/server/mo/<code>/LC_MESSAGES/cms.mo
for every country code.

* CONFIGURATION

Then you need to configure CMS, copying
$CMSPATH/example/cms.conf.sample onto $CMSPATH/example/cms.conf and
changing the value as you prefer. In particular, since we are using
SQLite, you need to remove the key "database" and change
"_database_sqlite" in "database'.

* PYTHONPATH

The last thing to do is to instruct Python to search for modules also
in $CMSPATH. You need to write on every terminal where you want to run
some CMS service the following: $ export PYTHONPATH=$CMSPATH/

* IMPORTING AND RUNNING

Finally, you can run the services. We are going first to run the
services for logging and file storage, then we are importing a sample
contest, and finally we are going to run all the services for the
given contest. In every terminal, enter in the directory $CMSPATH.

These (one for each terminal) run the logging and file capabilities.
$ ./cms/service/LogService.py 0
$ ./cms/service/FileStorage.py 0

This import the contest in the given directory:
$ ./contrib/ContestImporter.py -s 0 /path/to/contest/

After the importer ended, you can run the other services with:
$ ./cms/service/Worker.py 0
$ ./cms/service/EvaluationServer.py 0
$ ./cms/service/ContestWebServer.py 0
$ ./cms/service/AdminWebServer.py 0
The middle two are contest-dependent, hence they are going to ask you
which contest you want to load before starting.


** INSTALL AND RUN IT FROM THE SYSTEM
