DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN CMS AND IOI 2011 OFFICIAL RULES
=====================================================

This document details the differences between the current capabilities
of CMS and the official IOI 2011 rules, i.e., the features that need
to be added to CMS to fully comply with the rules used in 2011.

Warning: I'm working with rules detailed here[1], which appear to be
draft. I don't know where to find a more up-to-date copy.

 * Attachments: the contestants must be able to download skeleton
   implementations and other files related to some task from the Web
   interface; in CMS database there is a table 'attachments' for this
   sort of files, but the Web interface doesn't show anything.

 * Programming tasks: not implemented.

 * RunC interface, both command-line and gedit plugin versions: not
   implemented.

 * Translation support: does the IOI 2011 Web interface served
   translated task statements?

 * Clarification requests: according to the rules, clarification
   requests can happen only via paper requests, so our support in the
   Web interface is, strictly speaking, not according to the
   rules. Moreover, there is no way to electronically handle the
   translation of questions (and the database doesn't support it).

 * Cheating logging: the rules consider cheating also "probing the
   server with customized URL"; probably we could create a "cheat log"
   where we log events like this.

 * Nearly all the Competition Server is ill-worded, and interpreting
   it strictly would make most of CMS not according to the rules
   (e.g., it implicitly assumes that there is only one Competition
   Server and that it runs on the same hardware as the contestants'
   computer, while the only logical requirements is that the workers
   run in the same environment as contestants).

 * Printing interface: not implemented.

 * Multiple-files submissions (via a single .zip file): not
   implemented.

 * Test interface: not implemented (and probably we also need some
   modification to the database to support it).

 * Audible end signals: probably the system must offer some interface
   to trigger the audible signals that mark the end of the
   competition.

 * Re-evaluation: according to the rules, contestants are notified
   when some of their submissions if re-evaluated; it for some reason
   we do mass re-evaluation, we need an automated system to manage all
   the notifications.

 * Submission details grouped into subtasks: not implemented.
